# Introduce Us
This is a website that visualizes the diversity of USC students' preferences, perceptions, and experiences.
This website requires at least a local host to run as we fetch the data from a local xlsx directly. If you use OS X, running the following command in the project directory would suffice:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

**Landing page**

From the image above, the landing page includes the map of University of Southern California (USC) with several people-like icons on it. The locations of those icons are designated based on their majors and partially randomized. When you hover your cursor over it, the page will display a brief information of the person. When an icon is clicked, the website will switch to another page that shows the full information of the person in the timeline format.

**Timeline page**

This project has been developed as one of the projects in a USC student organization called Corpus Callosum that aims to bridge between science, technology, and art.
We changed all the names of the respondents to "Anonymous" for the sake of information privacy.
