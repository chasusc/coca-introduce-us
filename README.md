# Introduce Us
This is a website that visualizes the diversity of USC students' preferences, perceptions, and experiences.
This website requires at least a local host to run as we fetch the data from a local xlsx directly. If you use OS X, running the following command in the project directory would suffice:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
This project has been developed as a part of a USC student organization called Corpus Callosum.
