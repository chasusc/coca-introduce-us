# Introduce Us
This is a website that visualizes the diversity of USC students' preferences, perceptions, and experiences.
This website requires at least a local host to run as we fetch the data from a local xlsx directly. If you use OS X, running the following command in the project directory would suffice:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
<div id="container">
    ![landing page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chasusc/coca-introduce-us/master/pictures/Landing_page.png)
    This is an image
</div>

#container {
    height:100px;
    line-height:100px;
}

#container img {
    vertical-align:middle;
    max-height:100%;
}

This project has been developed as one of the projects in a USC student organization called Corpus Callosum that aims to bridge between science, technology, and art.
We changed all the names of the respondents to "Anonymous" for the sake of information privacy.
